# P42 Prizes Deployment Flow

P42 Prizes is a standalone Next.js app. The canonical public route is `https://projectforty2.ai/prizes`, but the app source and deployment lifecycle live in this repo.

## Ownership

| Surface | Owner | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prize portal UI, API routes, problem metadata, agent docs | `techno-optimist/p42-prizes` | Make product/protocol changes here. |
| `projectforty2.ai/prizes` link and reverse proxy | `techno-optimist/observatory` | Only route traffic to the standalone prize service. |
| Old static ProjectForty2 checkout | none for prizes | Do not copy or deploy prize assets from there. |

## Render

The prize service should be a Render web service connected to this repo. The checked-in `render.yaml` captures the intended service configuration.

Build command:

```bash
cd web && npm ci && npm run build:prizes
```

Start command:

```bash
cd web && npm run start:prizes
```

Environment:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/prizes
```

Health check path:

```bash
/prizes
```

## Observatory Proxy

The ProjectForty2 public backend proxies `/prizes/*` to the standalone prize service. Its production default origin is:

```bash
https://p42-prizes.onrender.com
```

If the Render service URL changes, set `P42_PRIZES_ORIGIN` on `observatory-backend` and keep the proxy default in sync.

## Agent Checklist

Before pushing a prize-site change:

1. Run `cd web && npm test`.
2. Run `cd web && npm run build`.
3. Run `cd web && npm run build:prizes`.
4. Confirm machine links render under `/prizes`, especially `/prizes/skill.md`, `/prizes/api/problems`, and `/prizes/api/leaderboard?...`.
5. Keep real ETH, onramp, and settlement language gated until audit, legal review, deterministic CI, and resolver work are complete.

Before pushing an Observatory change:

1. Confirm it only links to or proxies the standalone prize service.
2. Run `python3 -m py_compile backend/main.py backend/public_dgx_hardening.py`.
3. Smoke `https://projectforty2.ai/prizes` after Render deploy.
